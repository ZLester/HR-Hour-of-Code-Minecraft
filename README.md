### Hack Reactor's Custom Hour of Code MineCraft Module
* Review the [Young Person's How-To Guide to Programming in MineCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/YoungPersonsGuideToProgrammingMinecraft.md#introduction) prior to presenting.
* Install Minecraft on your system using the [official OSX installer](https://launcher.mojang.com/download/Minecraft.dmg).
* *From the server folder* (important, otherwise you will be unable to access the preconfigured server and instead create a new one), run `sudo java -jar CanaryMod-1.8.0-1.2.1-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar` in terminal.
* Boot Minecraft and input login credentials (provided by Erin or Matthew).
* Direct connect to your local server via entering `localhost` as address.
* Walk through How-To Guide with students.
* I've added a few useful prebuilt commands in `commands.js`, though the How-To cotains many more
